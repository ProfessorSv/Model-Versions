# Probing Feedback Integrity in a Neuroimmune Model of Allergic Inflammation

This repository contains the complete codebase and data for the MSc dissertation project titled "Probing Feedback Integrity in a Neuroimmune Model of Allergic Inflammation". The project implements, calibrates, and extends a four-compartment ordinary differential equation (ODE) model—the Engram-Immune Model (EIM)—to investigate the role of neuroimmune feedback in the context of allergic disease and its modulation by Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS).

## Project Overview

The core of this work involves:
1.  **Model Calibration:** Implementing the EIM from Fadai et al. (2024) and calibrating its parameters against experimental time-course data for Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) and chemokines from a murine House Dust Mite (HDM) allergy model (Gregory et al., 2009).
2.  **VNS Simulation:** Introducing a data-driven, proportional VNS suppression term (`-μ * v(t) * y`) into the model to simulate the effects of neurostimulation.
3.  **Hypothesis Testing:** Investigating the model's prediction of a "runaway engram" effect, where VNS paradoxically worsens inflammation under weak feedback, and testing the hypothesis that strengthening the feedback parameter `ξ` restores therapeutic efficacy.

## Repository Structure

-   `/data`: Contains all raw and processed `.csv` files used for model calibration, digitized from the source literature.
-   `/scripts`: Contains all Python scripts (`.py`) used for simulation, parameter fitting, and figure generation.
-   `/figures`: Contains key figures and plots generated by the scripts.

## Installation & Setup

To run these simulations, you will need Python 3.9+ and the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The Python scripts in the `/scripts` directory are designed to be run sequentially to reproduce the findings of the dissertation. For example, to reproduce the final VNS simulation:

```bash
python scripts/eim_with_vagal_styled_days.py
```

## Data Sources

All experimental data were digitized from the following key publications:
